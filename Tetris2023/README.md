This code aims to build a tetris game using the SDL library.

The playfield and the score are displayed in a window created with SDL.
A random tetromino (shape and color) is generated at the top of the playfield and must be placed at the bottom. 
It is falling and can be controlled with the keyboard.


The program can be compiled by the command "make" and then you can execute the file tetris_toy to launch the game (requires SDL library).

There is a hard mode which can be activated by pressing SPACE.
